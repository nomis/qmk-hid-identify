 * Retrieves the device's Usage Page and Usage from the report descriptor.
 * The algorithm returns the current Usage Page/Usage pair whenever a new
 * Collection is found and a Usage Local Item is currently in scope.
 * Usage Local Items are consumed by each Main Item (See. 6.2.2.8).
 * The algorithm should give similar results as Apple's:
 *   https://developer.apple.com/documentation/iokit/kiohiddeviceusagepairskey?language=objc
 * Physical Collections are also matched (macOS does the same).
 *
 * This function can be called repeatedly until it returns non-0
 * Usage is found. pos is the starting point (initially 0) and will be updated
 * to the next search position.
 *
 * The return value is 0 when a pair is found.
 * 1 when finished processing descriptor.
 * -1 on a malformed report.
